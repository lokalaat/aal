				The Animal Assistance League of Slidell works in-partnership with Slidell Animal Control.
				<br><br>
				Animal Control Officers patrol the city, keeping the streets free of stray animals and enforcing animal-related ordinances. In addition, the officers investigate animal cruelty cases, issue citations, inspect pet shops, and inspect private and commercial kennels within the city limits. Animal Control Officers also handle all bite cases occurring within city limits.
				<br><br>
				The Office of Animal Control houses and cares for animals either picked up by Animal Control Officers or brought to the shelter by private citizens.
				<br><br>
				Together, we try to find homes for abandoned animals and work to educate the public on the safe and humane treatment of animals.
